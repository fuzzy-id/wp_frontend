* WP Frontend â€“ a web front end to the Waterkotte 8126

This is a web frontend written against some scripts that can be found
on:
ftp://linux-magazin.de/pub/magazin/2010/06/Pumpensteuerung/

The back end part is OK and we could adapt it to our needs. Anyhow, the
front end was written in such a bad way and so chaotic, that I decided
to write my own one as a WSGI application on top of Pyramid[fn:1].

This is the first web application I wrote, so you can find some ugly
design decisions I haven't come yet to resolve. Another thing is that
I had to deal with some design decisions made by the author of the
back end that I myself would have made surely different. Anyway, we
have almost 99% test coverage, the look is OK and all the plots work.
