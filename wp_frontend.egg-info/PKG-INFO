Description: 
        * WP Frontend – a web front end to the Waterkotte 8126
        
        This is a web frontend written against some scripts that some time ago
        were presented in the German ‘Linux Magazin’.[fn:2]
        
        The back end part is OK and we could adapt it to our needs. Anyhow, the
        front end was written in such a bad way and so chaotic, that I decided
        to write my own one as a WSGI application on top of Pyramid[fn:1].
        
        This is the first web application I wrote, so you can find some ugly
        design decisions I haven't come yet to resolve. Another thing is that
        I had to deal with some design decisions made by the author of the
        back end that I myself would have made surely different. Anyway, we
        have almost 99% test coverage, the look is OK and all the plots work.
